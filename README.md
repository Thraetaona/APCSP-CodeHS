# Notes and Considerations

1. Everything within the folder named "AP Computer Science Principles in Python" is my own work and, unless other stated explicitly (as in the files named "CreatePerformanceTask.py" and "CreateyourUltraKarelImage!.py"), is hereby released into the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0) license.
2. The codes were hastily written and were not designed for maintainablity, albeit their quality is still well-above the general course requirements.
3. The provided program codes should suffice for a full course completion of CodeHS' AP CSP Python courses as seen below.  Be aware that the "reflections" or project-assignments that were not checked/verified by CodeHS are not provided here.
